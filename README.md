## 🚀 Deployment Link

https://fyle-internship-may.vercel.app/

## 🌟 Features

- **Search by Username**: Users can enter a GitHub username to search for and view the public repositories of that user.
- **Zero State Handling**: If a user is not found, an empty state is displayed while still allowing users to search for other usernames.
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination is implemented, allowing users to view repositories in chunks. Users can select the page size and navigate through pages.
- **Loading Indicators**: Skeleton loaders are displayed to indicate when API calls are in progress.
- **Caching**: API calls to GitHub's REST API are cached to avoid duplicate calls.
